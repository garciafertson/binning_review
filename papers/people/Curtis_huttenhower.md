Structure, function and diversity of the healthy human microbiome
up to 99 percent of the genera, enzyme families and community configurations occupied by the health Western microbiome.
Metagenomic carraige of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure. Ethnic/racial background proved to be one fo the strongest associatios of both pathwyas and microbes with clinical metadata.

Has pca plots of species diversity between ome sites
Some of the best graphs ive ever seen
Has a plot showing that although the types of phyla that live in each site change significantly, the metabolic pathways remain constant(ish)

METHODS
16S data processing and diversity estimates	QIIME
metagenomic data were taxonomically profiled with 	MetaPh1An
metabolically profiled by 	HUMAnN
assembled for gene annotation and clustering into a unique catalog
pathogens were identified using 	PATRIC database
isolate reference genomes annotations drawn from	KEGG
reference genome mapping performed by	BWA to a redued set of genomes for matching
Microial associations were assed by similarity measures accounting for compositionallity and phenotypic association testing was performed in R
Additional methods were in the supplimentary but i cant find them
