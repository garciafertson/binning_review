Abstract
Background/Introduction
	Binning problem definition	(recover biological entities from metagenomic sequencing)
		problem relevance	(Explosion in metagenomics, reduction in sequencing cost, increased computer capacity)
	Review objectives	(Brief summary on popular tools, overview of innovations of recent tools)

Popular/Previous Binning software
		Proposed solutions	(bin contings into bins(MAG if good quality) based on their kmer composition and abundance/coabundance)
		Tools available	(Cite recent benchmark)
	Review objectives	(Overview of recent software, )

Overview of recent metagenomic binning tools
	Inovations in binning tools
		Inovations in proposed solutions/ strategy innovations
			Read binning
			gene-abundance binning
				CAG, MGS, MSP
			Integrate new experimental data
		Software/algorithms innovations
			machine-learning/deep-learning implementations
	Inovations in specific biological questions
		Viral genomes and viral strains
		Endosymbionts
		
Choosing a binning algorithm
	Identifiy start point variables
		Sample origin (Host contamination, diversity)
		Number of samples (some tools require many samples to perform well)
		Sequencing technology (Most tools employ illumina, LongReads are increasing)
		Computational resources available
	Identify endpoint
		organism of interest viral(ref viral catalogue), bacteria, all

	Tools are complementary MSP/Metabat

Conclusions
	Current limitations and future directions
		Do not perform well on multiple strains, on the same sample
